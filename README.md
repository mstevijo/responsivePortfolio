Stevi Malinowsk's Responsive Portfolio

This project was about incorperating responsive design using bootstrap and bootstrap grid system as well as, static html into a protfolio styled theme. we were required to have at least the three pages of Home/Index - Portfolio - Contact. All HTML was to be verified with a validation service. We also had to make sure to use semantic HTML and have working links.
